## What is Zep? üí¨ 
Zep is a long-term memory service for AI Assistant apps. With Zep, you can provide AI assistants with the ability to recall past conversations, no matter how distant, while also reducing hallucinations, latency, and cost. 

### How Zep works

Zep does all of this asynchronously, ensuring these operations don't impact your user's chat experience. Data is persisted to database, allowing you to scale out when growth demands.

Zep also provides a simple, easy to use abstraction for document vector search called Document Collections. This is designed to complement Zep's core memory features, but is not designed to be a general purpose vector database.

Zep allows you to be more intentional about constructing your prompt: 
1. automatically adding a few recent messages, with the number customized for your app;
2. a summary of recent conversations prior to the messages above;
3. and/or contextually relevant summaries or messages surfaced from the entire chat session.
4. and/or relevant Business data from Zep Document Collections.

## What is Zep Cloud? ‚ö°Ô∏è 

[Zep Cloud](https://www.getzep.com/) is a managed service with Zep Open Source at its core. In addition to Zep Open Source's memory management features, Zep Cloud offers:
- **Fact Extraction:** Automatically build fact tables from conversations, without having to define a data schema upfront.
- **Dialog Classification:** Instantly and accurately classify chat dialog. Understand user intent and emotion, segment users, and more. Route chains based on semantic context, and trigger events. 
- **Structured Data Extraction:** Quickly extract business data from chat conversations using a schema you define. Understand what your Assistant should ask for next in order to complete its task.

# Async Client

```python
from zep.client import AsyncZep
from zep.types import Memory, Message

client = AsyncZep(
    api_key=API_KEY,
)

# Create a user
user_id = uuid.uuid4().hex  # unique user id. can be any alphanum string

await client.user.add(
    user_id=user_id,
    email="user@example.com",
    first_name="Jane",
    last_name="Smith",
    metadata={"vip": "true"},
)

# Create session associated with the above user

await client.memory.add_session(session_id=session_id, user_id=user_id, metadata={"foo": "bar"})

# Update session metadata
await client.memory.update_session(session_id=session_id, metadata={"bar": "foo"})

# Get session
session = await client.memory.get_session(session_id)

# Add Memory for session
for m in history:

    message = Message(**m)
    memory = Memory(messages=[message])
    await client.memory.create(session_id=session_id, request=memory)

# Synthesize a question from most recent messages.
# Useful for RAG apps. This is faster than using an LLM chain.
question = await client.memory.synthesize_question(session_id, last_n_messages=3)

# Classify the session.
# Useful for semantic routing, filtering, and many other use cases.
classes = [
    "low spender <$50",
    "medium spender >=$50, <$100",
    "high spender >=$100",
    "unknown",
]
classification = await client.memory.classify_session(
    session_id, name="spender_category", classes=classes, persist=True
)

# Get Memory for session
memory = await client.memory.get(session_id, memory_type="perpetual")

# Search Memory for session
query = "What are Jane's favorite show brands?"
summary_result = await client.memory.search(session_id, text=query, search_scope="summary")

summary_mmr_result = await client.memory.search(session_id, text=query, search_scope="summary", search_type="mmr")

messages_result = await client.memory.search(
    session_id,
    text=query,
    search_scope="messages",
    metadata={"where": {"jsonpath": '$[*] ? (@.bar == "foo")'}}
)

# Delete Memory for session
await client.memory.delete(session_id)
```

# Beta Status

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major 
version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning the package version to a specific version. 
This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes.

# Contributing

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically. 
Additions made directly to this library would have to be moved over to our generation code, 
otherwise they would be overwritten upon the next generated release. Feel free to open a PR as
 a proof of concept, but know that we will not be able to merge it as-is. We suggest opening 
an issue first to discuss with us!

On the other hand, contributions to the README are always very welcome!
